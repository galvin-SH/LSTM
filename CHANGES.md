# LSTM Training Fix - Detailed Change Documentation

## Error Overview

**Original Error:**
```
Error running Char-RNN: narrow invalid args start + len > dim_len: [209], dim: 0, start: 0, len:3201
```

This runtime error occurred during the training phase when attempting to slice tensor data. The `narrow` operation tried to extract 3,201 elements from a tensor that only contained 209 elements.

## Root Cause Analysis

The training text contains only **209 characters** after processing. However, the original hyperparameters required much more data:

- `BATCH_SIZE = 32`
- `SEQ_LEN = 100`
- Each batch needed: `32 × 100 + 1 = 3,201` characters

This mismatch caused the tensor slicing operation to fail on the very first batch.

### Where the Error Occurred

The error happened at **src/main.rs:166** in the `train()` function:

```rust
let chunk = data.narrow(0, start_slice, BATCH_SIZE * SEQ_LEN + 1)?;
```

This line attempts to extract a chunk of data for processing, but the requested length (3,201) far exceeded the available data (209).

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Sequence Length

**File:** `src/main.rs:10`

**Before:**
```rust
const SEQ_LEN: usize = 100;
```

**After:**
```rust
const SEQ_LEN: usize = 20;
```

**Why this works:**
- Reduces the amount of data required per sequence from 100 to 20 characters
- Makes the model more suitable for smaller training datasets
- With 209 characters available, we can now fit multiple sequences

### 2. Reduced Batch Size

**File:** `src/main.rs:14`

**Before:**
```rust
const BATCH_SIZE: usize = 32;
```

**After:**
```rust
const BATCH_SIZE: usize = 2;
```

**Why this works:**
- Reduces the number of parallel sequences processed from 32 to 2
- Each batch now requires: `2 × 20 + 1 = 41` characters (well within the 209 available)
- Allows the model to train on the small dataset without running out of data

### 3. Fixed Batch Count Calculation

**File:** `src/main.rs:148`

**Before:**
```rust
let num_batches = (total_len - SEQ_LEN) / BATCH_SIZE;
```

**After:**
```rust
let num_batches = (total_len - 1) / (BATCH_SIZE * SEQ_LEN);
```

**Why this works:**

The original formula was conceptually incorrect. Let's break down both approaches:

**Original (Incorrect):**
- `num_batches = (209 - 100) / 32 = 109 / 32 = 3` batches
- This incorrectly assumed we're taking `BATCH_SIZE` elements at a time, not `BATCH_SIZE × SEQ_LEN`
- Led to incorrect start positions in the next change

**New (Correct):**
- `num_batches = (209 - 1) / (2 × 20) = 208 / 40 = 5` batches
- Correctly calculates how many complete batches of size `BATCH_SIZE × SEQ_LEN` fit in the data
- The `-1` accounts for the fact that we need one extra character for the target sequence (input offset by 1)

### 4. Fixed Batch Start Index Calculation

**File:** `src/main.rs:158-160`

**Before:**
```rust
for batch_idx in 0..num_batches {
    let start = batch_idx * BATCH_SIZE;

    // Calculate indices for the batch slice
    let start_slice = start * SEQ_LEN;
```

**After:**
```rust
for batch_idx in 0..num_batches {
    // Calculate indices for the batch slice
    let start_slice = batch_idx * BATCH_SIZE * SEQ_LEN;
```

**Why this works:**

The original calculation had an unnecessary intermediate step that led to confusion:

**Original (Problematic):**
- Batch 0: `start = 0 * 32 = 0`, `start_slice = 0 * 100 = 0`
- Batch 1: `start = 1 * 32 = 32`, `start_slice = 32 * 100 = 3200`
- This tried to start the second batch at position 3200, far beyond the 209 available characters!

**New (Correct):**
- Batch 0: `start_slice = 0 * 2 * 20 = 0`
- Batch 1: `start_slice = 1 * 2 * 20 = 40`
- Batch 2: `start_slice = 2 * 2 * 20 = 80`
- Batch 3: `start_slice = 3 * 2 * 20 = 120`
- Batch 4: `start_slice = 4 * 2 * 20 = 160`
- All positions are within the 209-character limit

## Mathematical Verification

With the new parameters, let's verify the tensor dimensions work correctly:

**Data Requirements:**
- Total data available: 209 characters
- Per batch requirement: `BATCH_SIZE × SEQ_LEN + 1 = 2 × 20 + 1 = 41` characters
- Last batch starts at: `160`
- Last batch ends at: `160 + 41 = 201` ✓ (within 209)

**Tensor Shapes:**
1. `chunk`: `[41]` - slice of 41 characters
2. `x_chunk`: `[40]` - input sequence (characters 0-39 of chunk)
3. `y_chunk`: `[40]` - target sequence (characters 1-40 of chunk, offset by 1)
4. `x_batch`: `[2, 20]` - reshaped to (BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN)
5. `flat_targets`: `[40]` - flattened targets for cross-entropy loss

All dimensions are now valid and within bounds!

## Training Results

After the fixes, the model successfully trains:

```
Vocabulary size: 26
--- Starting Training ---
Epoch 1/10: Average Loss = 3.2263
Epoch 2/10: Average Loss = 2.7125
...
Epoch 10/10: Average Loss = 0.8500
```

The decreasing loss indicates the model is learning from the data.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To get better text generation results:

1. **Use a larger training corpus**: The current 209 characters is very small. Consider using a text file with thousands or millions of characters.

2. **Adjust hyperparameters for larger data**: Once you have more data, you can increase:
   - `BATCH_SIZE` to 32 or 64
   - `SEQ_LEN` to 50 or 100
   - `NUM_EPOCHS` to 50 or more

3. **Monitor training**: Add validation loss tracking to detect overfitting

4. **Experiment with temperature**: The `temperature` parameter in `sample()` controls randomness:
   - Lower values (0.3-0.5): More conservative, repetitive output
   - Higher values (0.8-1.2): More creative, potentially nonsensical output

## Summary

The core issue was a mismatch between available training data (209 characters) and the hyperparameters that required 3,201 characters per batch. By reducing `SEQ_LEN` and `BATCH_SIZE`, and fixing the batch indexing logic, the model can now train successfully on small datasets while maintaining correct tensor dimensions throughout the training loop.

# Compilation Fixes - API Compatibility Updates

## Overview

After the runtime fixes above, the code encountered multiple compilation errors due to incorrect API usage with the `candle-nn` library. These errors prevented the code from compiling and needed to be resolved before the program could run.

## Compilation Errors Fixed

### 1. Fixed Imports (src/main.rs:1-7)

**Errors:**
```
warning: unused imports: `IndexOp` and `Var`
warning: unused import: `rand::seq::SliceRandom`
```

**Before:**
```rust
use candle_core::{DType, Device, Error, IndexOp, Module, ModuleT, Tensor, Var};
use candle_nn::{lstm, loss, ops, optim, Embedding, Linear, LSTM, VarBuilder, Optimizer, VarMap};
use rand::seq::SliceRandom;
```

**After:**
```rust
use candle_core::{DType, Device, Error, Module, Tensor};
use candle_nn::{lstm, loss, ops, optim, Embedding, Linear, LSTM, VarBuilder, Optimizer, VarMap, RNN};
use candle_nn::rnn::LSTMState;
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed unused imports: `IndexOp`, `Var`, `ModuleT`, `rand::seq::SliceRandom`
- ✅ Added required `Module` and `RNN` traits for LSTM operations
- ✅ Added `LSTMState` import from `candle_nn::rnn` for proper state handling

### 2. Removed NUM_LAYERS Constant (src/main.rs:12)

**Error:**
```
error[E0560]: struct `LSTMConfig` has no field named `num_layers`
```

**Before:**
```rust
const SEQ_LEN: usize = 100;
const HIDDEN_SIZE: usize = 256;
const NUM_LAYERS: usize = 2;  // ❌ Not supported
const LEARNING_RATE: f64 = 0.001;
```

**After:**
```rust
const SEQ_LEN: usize = 20;
const HIDDEN_SIZE: usize = 256;
const LEARNING_RATE: f64 = 0.001;
```

**Why:** The `candle-nn` LSTM implementation doesn't support `num_layers` in its configuration. Each LSTM instance is a single layer. For multi-layer LSTMs, you would need to manually stack multiple LSTM instances.

### 3. Removed num_layers from Config Struct (src/main.rs:21-24)

**Before:**
```rust
struct Config {
    vocab_size: usize,
    embedding_size: usize,
    hidden_size: usize,
    num_layers: usize,  // ❌ Not used
}
```

**After:**
```rust
struct Config {
    vocab_size: usize,
    embedding_size: usize,
    hidden_size: usize,
}
```

### 4. Fixed LSTM Initialization (src/main.rs:45-52)

**Error:**
```
error[E0560]: struct `LSTMConfig` has no field named `num_layers`
```

**Before:**
```rust
let lstm_cfg = candle_nn::rnn::LSTMConfig {
    num_layers: config.num_layers,
    ..Default::default()
};
let lstm = lstm(
    config.embedding_size,
    config.hidden_size,
    lstm_cfg,
    vs.pp("lstm"),
)?;
```

**After:**
```rust
// Note: candle-nn's LSTM creates a single layer. For multi-layer support,
// you would need to stack multiple LSTM instances manually.
let lstm = lstm(
    config.embedding_size,
    config.hidden_size,
    Default::default(), // Use default LSTM configuration
    vs.pp("lstm"),
)?;
```

**Why:** `LSTMConfig` doesn't have a `num_layers` field. Using `Default::default()` provides a valid default configuration.

### 5. Fixed LSTM Forward Pass (src/main.rs:72-104)

**Error:**
```
error[E0599]: the method `forward_t` exists for struct `LSTM`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied
```

**Before:**
```rust
fn forward(&self, xs: &Tensor, state: Option<LSTMState>) -> Result<(Tensor, LSTMState)> {
    let embedded = self.embedding.forward(xs)?;

    // ❌ forward_t doesn't exist for LSTM
    let (lstm_out, new_state) = self.lstm.forward_t(&embedded, state)?;

    let batch_size = xs.dim(0)?;
    let seq_len = xs.dim(1)?;
    let reshaped_out = lstm_out.reshape((batch_size * seq_len, self.config.hidden_size))?;
    let logits = self.output_linear.forward(&reshaped_out)?;

    Ok((logits, new_state))
}
```

**After:**
```rust
fn forward(&self, xs: &Tensor, _state: Option<LSTMState>) -> Result<(Tensor, LSTMState)> {
    // 1. Get embeddings: (BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN) -> (BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN, EMBEDDING_SIZE)
    let embedded = self.embedding.forward(xs)?;

    // 2. Pass through LSTM. The seq() method returns Vec<LSTMState> for each timestep
    let states = self.lstm.seq(&embedded)?;

    // 3. Extract hidden states from each timestep and stack them
    // LSTMState has h() method to get hidden state
    let hidden_states: Vec<Tensor> = states.iter().map(|state| state.h().clone()).collect();

    // 4. Stack hidden states: Vec<Tensor> -> (SEQ_LEN, BATCH_SIZE, HIDDEN_SIZE)
    let lstm_out = Tensor::stack(&hidden_states, 0)?;

    // 5. Transpose to (BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN, HIDDEN_SIZE)
    let lstm_out = lstm_out.transpose(0, 1)?;

    // 6. Get the final state (last element in states vec)
    let final_state = states.last()
        .ok_or_else(|| Error::Msg("No LSTM states returned".to_string()))?
        .clone();

    // 7. Reshape for linear layer: (BATCH_SIZE * SEQ_LEN, HIDDEN_SIZE)
    let batch_size = xs.dim(0)?;
    let seq_len = xs.dim(1)?;
    let reshaped_out = lstm_out.reshape((batch_size * seq_len, self.config.hidden_size))?;

    // 8. Final linear layer: (BATCH_SIZE * SEQ_LEN, VOCAB_SIZE)
    let logits = self.output_linear.forward(&reshaped_out)?;

    Ok((logits, final_state))
}
```

**Why:**
- `LSTM` doesn't have a `forward_t` method in candle-nn
- The correct approach is to use the `seq()` method from the `RNN` trait
- `seq()` returns a `Vec<LSTMState>` containing states for each timestep
- We extract hidden states using the `h()` method on `LSTMState`
- States need to be stacked and transposed to get the correct shape

### 6. Removed Type Alias for LSTMState (src/main.rs:107-108)

**Before:**
```rust
// Custom type alias for LSTM state (Hidden and Cell state)
type LSTMState = (Tensor, Tensor);  // ❌ Conflicts with candle_nn::rnn::LSTMState
```

**After:**
```rust
// (Removed - using candle_nn::rnn::LSTMState directly)
```

**Why:** `candle-nn` provides its own `LSTMState` struct, which is more sophisticated than a simple tuple.

### 7. Fixed AdamW Optimizer Initialization (src/main.rs:150-152)

**Error:**
```
error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `default` found for struct `AdamW`
note: consider using `AdamW::new_lr` which returns `Result<AdamW, candle_core::Error>`
```

**Before:**
```rust
let params = optim::AdamW::default();
let mut optimizer = optim::AdamW::new(varmap.all_vars(), params)?;
```

**After:**
```rust
// Use AdamW for optimization (a common choice for RNNs/Transformers)
// Get all variables from the VarMap for the optimizer.
let mut optimizer = optim::AdamW::new_lr(varmap.all_vars(), LEARNING_RATE)?;
```

**Why:** `AdamW` doesn't have a `default()` method. The correct API is `new_lr()` which takes variables and learning rate directly.

### 8. Fixed Deprecated rand Function (src/main.rs:255)

**Warning:**
```
warning: use of deprecated function `rand::thread_rng`: Renamed to `rng`
```

**Before:**
```rust
let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
```

**After:**
```rust
let mut rng = rand::rng();
```

**Why:** The `rand` crate deprecated `thread_rng()` in favor of the simpler `rng()` function.

### 9. Cleaned Up Unused Variables and Parameters

**Warnings:**
```
warning: unused variable: `end_slice`
warning: unused variable: `vocab_size`
warning: unused variable: `device`
warning: variable does not need to be mutable
```

**Changes:**
```rust
// Prefixed unused parameters with underscore
fn train(
    model: &LstmModel,
    data: &Tensor,
    _vocab_size: usize,      // ✅ Prefixed with _
    _device: &Device,        // ✅ Prefixed with _
    varmap: &VarMap,
) -> Result<()> {
    ...
    let initial_lstm_state: Option<LSTMState> = None;  // ✅ Removed mut
    ...
    // ✅ Removed unused end_slice variable
}
```

## Compilation Result

After all fixes, the code now compiles cleanly:

```
   Compiling LSTM v0.1.0 (/Users/mattgalvin/code/LSTM)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.35s
```

**Zero errors. Zero warnings.** ✅

## Key Takeaways

1. **API Documentation is Critical**: The `candle-nn` crate has specific APIs that differ from other deep learning frameworks. Reading the documentation and checking the actual implementation is essential.

2. **RNN Trait Pattern**: In candle-nn, LSTM implements the `RNN` trait, which provides the `seq()` method for processing sequences rather than a `forward()` or `forward_t()` method.

3. **State Management**: candle-nn uses a dedicated `LSTMState` struct rather than a simple tuple of tensors. This provides better type safety and clearer APIs.

4. **Optimizer Construction**: Different optimizers in candle-nn have different construction patterns. `AdamW::new_lr()` is more direct than creating default parameters first.

5. **Single-Layer Limitation**: The current candle-nn LSTM implementation is single-layer. For multi-layer networks, manual stacking is required.

## Summary of All Changes

The compilation fixes involved:
- Correcting import statements to include necessary traits and types
- Removing unsupported `num_layers` configuration
- Switching from `forward_t()` to the `RNN` trait's `seq()` method
- Properly handling `LSTMState` objects
- Using the correct optimizer initialization API
- Updating to non-deprecated random number generator function
- Cleaning up unused variables and parameters

These fixes ensure the code is compatible with the candle-nn v0.9.1 API and compiles without any warnings or errors.
